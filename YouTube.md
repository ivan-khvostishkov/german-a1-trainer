When preparing for the exam, play the video in the Firefox browser on your mobile device and listen to it carefully through headphones from the locked screen while walking outside and breathing the fresh air.

For convenience and for regular training, the video has 7 parts, one for each day of the week:

* 00:00:00 Part 1 (Monday)
* 00:43:59 Part 2 (Tuesday)
* 01:27:44 Part 3 (Wednesday)
* 02:11:29 Part 4 (Thursday)
* 02:55:19 Part 5 (Friday)
* 03:39:10 Part 6 (Saturday)
* 04:22:44 Part 7 (Sunday)

The video is produced with the German A1 Trainer tool that  works by downloading the "Wortliste" PDF with approximately 650 German words and 850 sample phrases from the Goethe Insitut website, parsing it with Amazon Textract, extracting and translating the phrases from German into English by Amazon Translate and narrating the phrases with Amazon Polly. Finally, it assembles the audio files into a video file and hardcodes subtitles with FFMpeg.
